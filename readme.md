## Welcome

LinkText is a little more than a markup language, tending toward a
programming language. In fact, it can be used for a programming
language. It is a way to model information and computation in an easy to
read and write format, suitable for hierarchical note taking and other
means of capturing data down into structured form.

Check out the [BaseLink Book](https://github.com/termsurf/base.link) for
the most up-to-date info on the project! Specifically the pages on
Syntax, for a detailed spec on LinkText.
